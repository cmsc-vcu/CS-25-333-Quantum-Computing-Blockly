# Mancala Game

Welcome to Mancala! The objective is to have the most stones in your Mancala at the end of the game.

### Objective:
The goal of Mancala is to capture more stones (seeds) than your opponent by moving them around the board.

### Rules:
1. **Play**: On your turn, pick up all the stones from one of your pockets and place one stone in each pocket counterclockwise.
2. **Captures**: If the last stone you place is in an empty pit on your side, you capture the opposite pit's stones.
3. **Mancala**: If you land on your own Mancala, you place a stone in it and get another turn.
4. **End**: The game ends when one player has no more stones in their six pockets.
5. **Winner**: The player with the most stones in their Mancala at the end of the game wins.
